# DeviceFlow Manager

## Description
**DeviceFlow Manager** is a modular web-based system designed to manage and monitor connected devices and their data streams. The back-end architecture powers features such as real-time device communication, data processing, and system-wide monitoring, ensuring efficient and reliable operations.

---

## Key Features
1. **Data Stream Processing**: Handles large volumes of data with real-time processing capabilities.
2. **Device Management**: Provides configuration and status monitoring for connected devices.
3. **Scalable APIs**: Enables seamless integration with external systems using RESTful endpoints.
4. **Monitoring and Alerts**: Tracks system performance and raises alerts for anomalies.
5. **Secure User Management**: Ensures secure authentication and authorization with role-based access control.

## Logical Flow

### 1. **API Gateway**
   - The central entry point for all external and internal requests.
   - Responsibilities include:
     - **Input Validation**: Verifies the format and content of incoming requests.
     - **Routing**: Directs requests to appropriate services or microservices.
     - **Rate Limiting**: Manages request frequency to prevent system overload.
     - **Authentication and Authorization**:
       - Enforces role-based access for critical operations.

 
2. Data Repository Layer
Built on a relational database ( SQL Server).
Manages:
CRUD Operations: Create, read, update, and delete device configurations.
Data Indexing: Optimizes query performance for frequent operations.
Versioning: Tracks historical changes for audits.

3. Device Communication Layer
Uses WebSocket or SignalR for real-time communication with devices.
Core functionalities:
Command Dispatch: Sends configuration updates or commands to devices.
Status Monitoring: Tracks device availability through heartbeat signals.
Error Reporting: Logs device-specific errors for diagnostics.
Command Flow:

API receives a configuration request.
The request is validated and queued for the communication layer.
Configuration is sent to the device, and an acknowledgment is awaited.
4. Business Logic Layer
Executes core functionalities, including:
Rules Engine: Applies operational rules like thresholds and triggers.
Batch Processing: Optimizes handling of high-volume data during peak loads.
Anomaly Detection: Identifies irregular patterns in device data.


5. Monitoring and Alerts
Continuously monitors system health and device performance.
Raises alerts for:
Device outages.
Threshold breaches.
System performance degradation.
Alerts are sent via APIs, emails, or UI notifications and logged for audits.
Alert Workflow:

Monitoring service detects an anomaly.
Anomaly is logged and escalated to the notification service.
Alerts are displayed in the UI and sent to stakeholders.
6. Security and Authentication
Implements OAuth2 for secure, token-based authentication.
Uses role-based policies to restrict sensitive operations.
Logs all authentication attempts for auditing.
Security Features:

Automatic token refresh for active sessions.
IP-based restrictions for additional security.
Technologies Used
Back-End Framework: .NET 6 with ASP.NET Core.
Database: Microsoft SQL Server.
Real-Time Communication: SignalR or WebSocket.
Monitoring: Background services for diagnostics and alerts.
